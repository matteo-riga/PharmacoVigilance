For Pneumonia "On my fourth pill of Vantin in a few more hours, and I couldn't believe the rapidity of the healing! I am taking it for Klebsiella pneumoniae, along with Macrobid for Enterobacter bacteria! I have had dry mouth, dry throat, increased thirst, slight ringing in ears that has passed, headache, ugh, was the worst so far, but not horrible. Heavier menstrual period, a little dizziness, and hey! I'm penicillin allergic. So I think I'm doing A-1."
For Bronchitis "On the third pill I experienced very severe diarrhea which caused me to discontinue the medication. I am still experiencing the diarrhea even though I have been off the medicine for a few days. Also experiencing malaise and fatigue."
For Bladder Infection "I've had many urinary tract infections, and the normal medicines just quit working. I've been successfully treated with Vantin three times."
For Sinusitis "Vantin worked the best for me with sinusitis, whereas the 'z-pack' did not relieve me at all."
For Pneumonia "This antibiotic worked really fast with no side effects for me."
For Upper Respiratory Tract Infection "Works great..... No side effects and clears up my frequent sinus infections quickly!"
